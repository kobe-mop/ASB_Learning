UE attaches to the cell and completes RRC connection setup procedure. RRC:RRCConnectionSetup->radioResourceConfigDedicated->
mac-MainConfig sent by eNB does not contain skipUplinkTx-r14 IE

eNB sends RRC:RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to UE with radioResourceConfigDedicated->mac-MainConfig->skipUplinkTx-r14-setup->
skipUplinkTxDynamic-r14 IE included

If the MAC PDU includes only the MAC CE for padding BSR or periodic BSR with zero MAC SDUs and there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this TTI [2], 
the MAC entity shall not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity in the following cases:
-    in case the MAC entity is configured with skipUplinkTxDynamic and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a C-RNTI; or
-    in case the MAC entity is configured with skipUplinkTxSPS and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant;

DCI at 367/6 with apCQI request, UE shall send PUSCH at 368/2
DCI at 367/9 with no apCQI request, there was padding BSR in MAC CE, UE will skip pusch at 368/3.
