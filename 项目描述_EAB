This feature 172647 - Enhanced Access Barring for Machine Type Communication, supports Enhanced Access Barring (EAB) in SIB14. 
This enable eNB to restrict access from UEs configured for EAB, especially, in case a large number of MTC UEs try connecting to eNB.

How does a UE knows which Access Control Class it belongs to ? It is specified in EF_ACC field in USIM

There are several different ways for Access Control, but in terms of overall logic we can think of two different mechanism as listed below.
Type 1) Accept initial request from UE but Network send Reject message
Type 2) Prevent UE from trying initial access itself. (This type is called 'Barring')
       Case 1 : Bar every UE from any type of access even for emergency call (Configured by SIB1)
       Case 2 : Bar only specific UE (with specific marking in USIM) from a specific services (Configured by SIB2)

Type 1) is usually done by RRC Connection Reject in case of RRC layer, Attach Reject in case of NAS layer.
Type 2) is usually done by various SIB settings. Again in Type 2), a couple of different ways has been evolved as cellular technology evolves.
